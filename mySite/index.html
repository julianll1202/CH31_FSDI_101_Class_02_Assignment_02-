        <h3>About me</h3>

        <p>I'm a 19 year old student currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Systems Engineering at Instituto Tecnologico de Mexicali, as someone who is just discovering programming and software development, my current goal is to learn as much as I can about new technologies that are being used in big companies.</p>

        <p>Aside from that I am a fan of pop culture in general, I like to read, both books and comics, listen to music, watch movies and tv shows, I also like to draw. </p>
